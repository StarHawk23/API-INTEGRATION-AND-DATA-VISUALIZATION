DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

IN THIS TASK, I SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION USING PYTHON. INSTEAD OF USING WEATHER OR OPENWEATHERMAP API, I CHOSE TO WORK WITH THE COVID-19 PUBLIC API PROVIDED BY DISEASE.SH, WHICH OFFERS GLOBAL COVID-19 STATISTICS WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY API KEY. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS TASK WAS TO FETCH REAL-TIME DATA FROM AN API, PROCESS IT, AND THEN DISPLAY IT IN A VISUAL FORMAT FOR EASY UNDERSTANDING.

I USED THE ENDPOINT HTTPS://DISEASE.SH/V3/COVID-19/COUNTRIES TO COLLECT COUNTRY-WISE COVID DATA. I THEN FILTERED THIS DATA TO EXTRACT THE TOP 10 COUNTRIES BASED ON THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CONFIRMED CASES AND DEATHS. AFTER PROCESSING THE JSON RESPONSE, I USED MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN LIBRARIES FOR VISUALIZATION.

I CREATED TWO SEPARATE BAR CHARTS:

TOP 10 COUNTRIES BY TOTAL COVID-19 CASES

TOP 10 COUNTRIES BY TOTAL COVID-19 DEATHS

THE GRAPHS WERE CLEAR, COLORFUL, AND LABELLED PROPERLY FOR BETTER INTERPRETATION. THIS ALLOWED ME TO PRESENT CRITICAL DATA IN AN UNDERSTANDABLE WAY, HIGHLIGHTING THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC.

THE ENTIRE IMPLEMENTATION WAS DONE USING VISUAL STUDIO CODE (VS CODE), WHICH PROVIDED AN EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENT FOR WRITING, DEBUGGING, AND EXECUTING THE PYTHON CODE. I USED THE REQUESTS MODULE TO HANDLE THE API CALL, PARSED THE JSON RESPONSE, AND USED SEABORN FOR STYLISH GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE DATA.

THROUGH THIS TASK, I LEARNED HOW TO CONNECT TO EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES USING APIs, EXTRACT AND CLEAN DATA, AND THEN VISUALIZE THAT DATA IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. I ALSO GAINED HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE WITH REAL-WORLD DATA INTEGRATION AND PYTHON LIBRARIES SUCH AS REQUESTS, MATPLOTLIB, AND SEABORN.

THIS TASK MARKS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN UNDERSTANDING HOW DATA FLOWS FROM AN API INTO A PYTHON PROGRAM AND THEN INTO A GRAPHICAL VISUALIZATION, WHICH IS A VALUABLE SKILL FOR MODERN DATA-DRIVEN APPLICATIONS.
